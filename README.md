# ParaBank Testing with Cucumber + Selenium

This is a real world automation project built using **Cucumber (BDD)**, **Selenium WebDriver**, 
and **Java** to test user registration and login flows on [ParaBank](https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm).

**NOTE:** This project is currently in progress. I'm actively building out and refining the step definitions.
I want to demonstrate real world BDD practices with the Page Object Model (POM) framework.

## Project Goals:
- Automate the features of ParaBank using Cucumber feature files.
- Use Page Object Model and reusable methods
- Use assertions and validations to ensure correct behavior.
- Demonstrate my growing skills as a QA Automation Engineer.

## Tech Stack
- Java
- Cucumber BDD
- TestNG
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Maven (for dependencies)
